This script utilizes the X86DemoBoard to run a simple Ubunutu boot. The script
will boot the the OS to login before exiting the simulation.

A detailed terminal output can be found in `m5out/system.pc.com_1.device`.

**Warning:** The X86DemoBoard uses the Timing CPU. The boot may take
considerable time to complete execution.
`configs/example/gem5_library/x86-ubuntu-run-with-kvm.py` can be referenced as
an example of booting Ubuntu with a KVM CPU.

Usage
